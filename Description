  Segmentating customers can be very useful to track what segment is the most active in the company. This analysis allows a more precise definition of 
the targets of a marketing campaign (for example). A query was perfomed to find out the recency, monetary and frequency scores. These results were later used 
to identify the amount of customers that matches the characteristcs of each of the segments.  

      The results can be visualized in Looker Studio, using the link above.
