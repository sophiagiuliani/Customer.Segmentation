# Customer Segmentation 
## Analysis made using CRM scores

  Segmentating customers can be very useful to track what segment is the most active in the company. This analysis allows: 
  (1) data driven decision of the targets for a marketing campaign;
  (2) to keep track of customer's behavior;
 
  A query was perfomed to find out the recency, monetary and frequency scores. These results were later used 
to identify the amount of customers that matches the characteristcs of each of the segments.
