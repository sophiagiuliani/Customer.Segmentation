# Customer Segmentation 
## Analysis made using CRM scores

  The goal of this project is to create groups of customers defined by their behavior. Scores are attributed to different customers depending on their purchase habits, such as recency, frequency and the amount of money spent (monetary). 

  
  First, a query is perfomed to find out the recency, monetary and frequency of each customer. Then the percentiles for recency, monetary and frequency are defined. The next step is to attribute one score for each customer, depending on their purchase history. The last step is to create parameters for each of the segments. These results are later used to identify the amount of customers that matches the characteristcs of each of the segments.  

  With this information, a dashboard was created in Looker Studio to better visualize the results. It is possible to filter the results by category and/or by country to have a better understanding of the categories and compare the customers behavior by country.
